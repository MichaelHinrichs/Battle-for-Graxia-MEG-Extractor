# Megafile Extractor
 Written for games that use Megafiles, such as [Command & Conquer™ Remastered Collection](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1213210), [8-Bit Hordes](https://store.steampowered.com/app/497850),<br>
 [9-Bit Armies: A Bit Too Far](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1439750), [STAR WARS™ Empire at War - Gold Pack](https://store.steampowered.com/app/32470), Battle for Graxia, Victory Command,<br>
 and Universe at War: Earth Assault.

 Unfortunately, the last three are no longer avalible for purchase on steam.<br>
 If you have them in your library, you can still reinstall them with<br>
 steam://install/90530,<br>
 steam://install/360480, and<br>
 steam://install/10430 respectivly.

 This will NOT work with CONFIG.MEG. That file works differently for some reason.
