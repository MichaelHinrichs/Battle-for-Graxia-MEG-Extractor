# Megafile Extractor
 Written for games that use Megafiles, such as [Command & Conquerâ„¢ Remastered Collection](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1213210), Battle for Graxia, and Victory Command.

 Unfortunately, the later two are no longer avalible for purchase on steam.<br>
 If you have them in your library, you can still reinstall them with<br>
 steam://install/90530 and<br>
 steam://install/360480 respectivly.

 This will NOT work with CONFIG.MEG. That file works differently for some reason.
